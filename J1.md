# J1 Worksheet Questions 1-6 Ayushi Kriplani 
## Question 1 
Fault Localization is the idea of **tracing back** to a line or lines of your code that is at fault for producing an unexpected outcome. This usually entails using **print statements** to see the path the inputs are taking through the code. 

## Question 2 
### Writing the test cases prior to writing and designing my code has these benefits 
- My test cases are not biased by my code
- Test cases will help me think of all the potential inputs and cases that will aid me in my code design 
- Test Cases will help me keep the requirements of my system in mind 

## Question 3 
- Number test cases 
    - ("Ayu_7hi", valid)  //edge case -contains only one number in middle
    - ("5Yu_shi", valid)  //edge case - contains only one number at start
    - ("Ayu_sh1", valid)  //edge case - contains only one number at end
    - ("Ayu_shi", invalid)  //edge case - missing a number only

- UpperCase Test Cases
    - ("ayu_7Hi", valid) //edge case - contains only one uppercase letter in middle
    - ("Ayu_7hikri", valid) //edge case - contains only one uppercase letter at start
    - ("ayu_7hI", valid) //edge case - contains only one uppercase letter at end
    - ("ayu_7hi", invalid) //edge case - missing an uppercase letter only

- Lowercase Test Cases 
    - ("AYU_7hI", valid) //edge case - contains only one lowercase letter in middle
    - ("aYU_7HI", valid) //edge case - contains only one lowercase letter at start
    - ("AYU_7Hi", valid) //edge case - contains only one lowercase letter at end
    - ("AYU_7HI", invalid) //edge case - missing a lowercase letter only

- Gmail Test Cases 
    - ("Ayu_gmail7hi", invalid)  //edge case - contains "gmail" in middle
    -( "gmailAyu_7hi", invalid)  //edge case - contains "gmail" at start
    - ("Ayu_7higmail", invalid)  //edge case - contains "gmail" at end
    - ("Ayu_7ghmail", valid)  //edge case - does not contain "gmail" 

- Special Character Test Cases
    - ("Ayu_!7hi", invalid) //edge case- one not-allowed character in middle 
    - ("!Ayu_7hi", invalid) //edge case- one not-allowed character at start
    - ("Ayu_7hi!", invalid) //edge case - one not-allowed character at end 
    - ("Ayu_7h-i", invalid) //edge case - one not-allowed character in middle 
    - ("-Ayu_7hi", invalid) //edge case - one not-allowed character at start
    - ("Ayu_7hi-", invalid) //edge case - one not-allowed character at end

## Question 4  
| a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome |	clause responsible |
| ----  | - | ----- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
|T |T|T|T|(((a > b) or G )and(x < y))|
|T|T|F|F|x<y|
|T|F|T|T|(((a > b) or G )and(x < y))|
|T|F|F|F|x<y|
|F|T|T|T|(((a > b) or G )and(x < y))|
|F|T|F|F|x<y|
|F|F|T|F|a>b V G|
|F|F|F|F|(((a > b) or G )and(x < y))|

### Yes, it is a finite set 

## Question 6 
Mutation testing allows developers to test their test cases and test coverage through planting faults within the code base. When the test cases are rerun, the test cases should fail. This allows developers to ensure both the test cases and the code base are accounting for all possible outcomes, as opposed to believing the test cases as is. Test cases that are not vetted through a process like mutation testing could potentially be written under bias of the developer or could also not have an ideal test coverage percentage. 

According to the lecture notes, 

 [way to test the quality of the test suite, rather than the quality of the code, is to assume the current version of the code is “correct,” and then seed faults into that code base and re-run the test suite. A good test suite will now have at least one test case fail for such a seeded fault. Otherwise, it didn’t do a good enough job of testing the code.

This sort of fault seeding is also known as mutation testing because we are mutating the syntactic structures of the code to generate bugs automatically (which is why this sort of testing is feasibile – we know a buggy file should change the output).](https://cs2113-f24.github.io/j/software_testing)
