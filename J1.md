## Question 1 
### Fault Localization is the idea of **tracing back** to a line or lines of your code that is at fault for producing an unexpected outcome. This usually entails using **print statements** to see the path the inputs are taking through the code. 

## Question 2 
### Writing the test cases prior to writing and designing my code has these benefits 
    - My test cases are not biased by my code
    - Test cases will help me think of all the potential inputs and cases that will aid me in my code design 
    - Test Cases will help me keep the requirements of my system in mind
